# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This is a repository I'm using as I work through the exercises in SICP.

Initially I tried doing this in Emacs using Geiser to interact with Guile 2.2, but I was having a hard time getting my-reverse written.  So I switched to DrRacket instead since it's a more integrated environment.

I may switch again, but for now Racket seems to work great.
